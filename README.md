## Open Source

The App is fully open source: changed, built, signed, released by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/JohnBetaro/Signal-Android-AMOLED-Dark-Plus/actions) (without any human intervention), all of this is for the sake of transparency so you can see what's happening exactly. The [workflow file](https://github.com/JohnBetaro/Signal-Android-AMOLED-Dark-Plus/blob/dev/.github/workflows/sync-and-build.yml) that I made will automatically check for updates everyday from [johanw's repository](https://github.com/johanw666/Signal-Android) and will publish an update if there is any.
